Automatically add an Exec arg (field code) in the `.desktop` file.

This adds an `{exec_arg}` field to the default `main.desktop` template.
This field is populated with a sane default value, based on the
`deep_link_protocols` or `file_associations` in the `Config` struct.

This allows an installed Debian package to be invoked by other
applications with URLs or files as arguments, as expected.
